        # Create billable metrics programmatically with this endpointâ€”an essential step in
        # configuring your pricing and packaging in Metronome.
        #
        # A billable metric is a customizable query that filters and aggregates events
        # from your event stream. These metrics are continuously tracked as usage data
        # enters Metronome through the ingestion pipeline. The ingestion process
        # transforms raw usage data into actionable pricing metrics, enabling accurate
        # metering and billing for your products.
        #
        # ### Use this endpoint to:
        #
        # - Create individual or multiple billable metrics as part of a setup workflow.
        # - Automate the entire pricing configuration process, from metric creation to
        #   customer contract setup.
        # - Define metrics using either standard filtering/aggregation or a custom SQL
        #   query.
        #
        # ### Key response fields:
        #
        # - The ID of the billable metric that was created
        # - The created billable metric will be available to be used in Products, usage
        #   endpoints, and alerts.
        #
        # ### Usage guidelines:
        #
        # - Metrics defined using standard filtering and aggregation are Streaming
        #   billable metrics, which have been optimized for ultra low latency and high
        #   throughput workflows.
        # - Use SQL billable metrics if you require more flexible aggregation options.
