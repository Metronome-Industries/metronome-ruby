        # The ingest endpoint is the primary method for sending usage events to Metronome,
        # serving as the foundation for all billing calculations in your usage-based
        # pricing model. This high-throughput endpoint is designed for real-time streaming
        # ingestion, supports backdating 34 days, and is built to handle mission-critical
        # usage data with enterprise-grade reliability. Metronome supports 100,000 events
        # per second without requiring pre-aggregation or rollups and can scale up from
        # there. See
        # [Getting usage into Metronome](https://docs.metronome.com/connect-metronome/) to
        # learn more about usage events.
        #
        # Use this endpoint to:\
        # Create a customer usage pipeline into Metronome that drives billable metrics, credit
        # drawdown, and invoicing. Track customer behavior, resource consumption, and feature
        # usage
        #
        # What happens when you send events:
        #
        # - Events are validated and processed in real-time
        # - Events are matched to customers using customer IDs or customer ingest aliases
        # - Events are matched to billable metrics and are immediately available for usage
        #   and spend calculations
        #
        # Usage guidelines:
        #
        # - Historical events can be backdated up to 34 days and will immediately impact
        #   live customer spend
        # - Duplicate events are automatically detected and ignored (34-day deduplication
        #   window)
        #
        # Event structure: Usage events are simple JSON objects designed for flexibility
        # and ease of integration:
        #
        # ```json
        # {
        #   "transaction_id": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z_cluster42",
        #   "customer_id": "team@example.com",
        #   "event_type": "api_request",
        #   "timestamp": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        #   "properties": {
        #     "endpoint": "/v1/users",
        #     "method": "POST",
        #     "response_time_ms": 45,
        #     "region": "us-west-2"
        #   }
        # }
        # ```
        #
        # - Transaction ID\
        #   The transaction_id serves as your idempotency key, ensuring events are processed
        #   exactly once. Metronome maintains a 34-day deduplication window - significantly
        #   longer than typical 12-hour windows - enabling robust backfill scenarios without
        #   duplicate billing.
        #
        #   - Best Practices:
        #     - Use UUIDs for one-time events: uuid4()
        #     - For heartbeat events, use deterministic IDs
        #     - Include enough context to avoid collisions across different event sources
        #
        # - Customer ID\
        #   Identifies which customer should be billed for this usage. Supports two identification
        #   methods:
        #   - Metronome Customer ID: The UUID returned when creating a customer
        #   - Ingest Alias: Your system's identifier (email, account number, etc.)
        #
        # Ingest aliases enable seamless integration without requiring ID mapping, and
        # customers can have multiple aliases for flexibility.
        #
        # - Event Type: Categorizes the event type for billable metric matching. Choose
        #   descriptive names that aligns with the product surface area.
        #
        # - Properties: Flexible metadata also used to match billable metrics or to be
        #   used to serve as group keys to create multiple pricing dimensions or breakdown
        #   costs by novel properties for end customers or internal finance teams
        #   measuring underlying COGs.

        # This endpoint retrieves events by transaction ID for events that occurred within
        # the last 34 days. It is specifically designed for sampling-based testing
        # workflows to detect revenue leakage. The Event Search API provides a critical
        # observability tool that validates the integrity of your usage pipeline by
        # allowing you to sample raw events and verify their matching against active
        # billable metrics.
        #
        # Why event observability matters for revenue leakage: Silent revenue loss occurs
        # when events are dropped, delayed, or fail to match billable metrics due to:
        #
        # - Upstream system failures
        # - Event format changes
        # - Misconfigured billable metrics
        #
        # Use this endpoint to:
        #
        # - Sample raw events and validate they match the expected billable metrics
        # - Build custom leakage detection alerts to prevent silent revenue loss
        # - Verify event processing accuracy during system changes or metric updates
        # - Debug event matching issues in real-time
        #
        # Key response fields:
        #
        # - Complete event details including transaction ID, customer ID, and properties
        # - Matched Metronome customer (if any)
        # - Matched billable metric information (if any)
        # - Processing status and duplicate detection flags

        # Usage guidelines:\
        # ⚠️ Important: This endpoint is heavily rate limited and designed for sampling workflows
        # only. Do not use this endpoint to check every event in your system. Instead, implement
