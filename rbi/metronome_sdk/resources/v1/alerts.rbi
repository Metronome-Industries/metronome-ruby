        # Create a new threshold notification to monitor customer spending, balances, and
        # billing metrics in real-time. Metronome's notification system provides
        # industry-leading speed with immediate evaluation capabilities, enabling you to
        # proactively manage customer accounts and prevent revenue leakage.
        #
        # This endpoint creates configurable threshold notifications that continuously
        # monitor various billing thresholds including spend limits, credit balances,
        # commitment utilization, and invoice totals. Threshold notifications can be
        # configured globally for all customers or targeted to specific customer accounts.
        #
        # ### Use this endpoint to:
        #
        # - Proactively monitor customer spending patterns to prevent unexpected overages
        #   or credit exhaustion
        # - Automate notifications when customers approach commitment limits or credit
        #   thresholds
        # - Enable real-time intervention for accounts at risk of churn or payment issues
        # - Scale billing operations by automating threshold-based workflows and
        #   notifications
        #
        # ### Key response fields:
        #
        # A successful response returns a CustomerAlert object containing:
        #
        # - The threshold notification configuration with its unique ID and current status
        # - The customer's evaluation status (ok, in_alarm, or evaluating)
        # - Threshold notification metadata including type, threshold values, and update
        #   timestamps
        #
        # ### Usage guidelines:
        #
        # - Immediate evaluation: Set `evaluate_on_create` : `true` (default) for instant
        #   evaluation against existing customers
        # - Uniqueness constraints: Each threshold notification must have a unique
        #   `uniqueness_key` within your organization. Use `release_uniqueness_key` :
        #   `true` when archiving to reuse keys
        # - Notification type requirements: Different threshold notification types require
        #   specific fields (e.g., `billable_metric_id` for usage notifications,
        #   `credit_type_id` for credit-based threshold notifications)
        # - Webhook delivery: Threshold notifications trigger webhook notifications for
        #   real-time integration with your systems. Configure webhook endpoints before
        #   creating threshold notifications
        # - Performance at scale: Metronome's event-driven architecture processes
        #   threshold notification evaluations in real-time as usage events stream in,
        #   unlike competitors who rely on periodic polling or batch evaluation cycles

        # - Free up uniqueness keys for reuse with new threshold notifications

        #   configuration data
        # - Disable outdated monitoring rules during pricing model transitions

        #   re-enabled; create a new threshold notification to resume monitoring
        # - Uniqueness key handling: Set `release_uniqueness_key` : `true` to reuse the
        #   key in future threshold notifications
        # - Immediate effect: Threshold notification evaluation stops instantly across all
        #   customers
