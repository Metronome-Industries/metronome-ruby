        # Get a comprehensive audit trail of all operations performed in your Metronome
        # account, whether initiated through the API, web interface, or automated
        # processes. This endpoint provides detailed logs of who did what and when,
        # enabling compliance reporting, security monitoring, and operational
        # troubleshooting across all interaction channels.
        #
        # ### Use this endpoint to:
        #
        # - Monitor all account activity for security and compliance purposes
        # - Track configuration changes regardless of source (API, UI, or system)
        # - Investigate issues by reviewing historical operations
        #
        # ### Key response fields:
        #
        # An array of AuditLog objects containing:
        #
        # - id: Unique identifier for the audit log entry
        # - timestamp: When the action occurred (RFC 3339 format)
        # - actor: Information about who performed the action
        # - request: Details including request ID, IP address, and user agent
        # - resource_type: The type of resource affected (e.g., customer, contract,
        #   invoice)
        # - resource_id: The specific resource identifier
        # - action: The operation performed
        # - next_page: Cursor for continuous log retrieval
        #
        # ### Usage guidelines:
        #
        # - Continuous retrieval: The next_page token enables uninterrupted log
        #   streamingâ€”save it between requests to ensure no logs are missed
        # - Empty responses: An empty data array means no new logs yet; continue polling
        #   with the same next_page token
        # - Date filtering:
        #   - `starting_on`: Earliest logs to return (inclusive)
        #   - `ending_before`: Latest logs to return (exclusive)
        #   - Cannot be used with `next_page`
        # - Resource filtering: Must specify both resource_type and resource_id together
        # - Sort order: Default is date_asc; use date_desc for newest first
