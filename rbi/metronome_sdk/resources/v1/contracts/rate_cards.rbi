          # In Metronome, the rate card is the central location for your pricing. Rate cards
          # were built with new product launches and pricing changes in mind - you can
          # update your products and pricing in one place, and that change will be
          # automatically propagated across your customer cohorts. Most clients need only
          # maintain one or a few rate cards within Metronome.
          #
          # ### Use this endpoint to:
          #
          # - Create a rate card with a name and description
          # - Define the rate card's single underlying fiat currency, and any number of
          #   conversion rates between that fiat currency and custom pricing units. You can
          #   then add products and associated rates in the fiat currency or custom pricing
          #   unit for which you have defined a conversion rate.
          # - Set aliases for the rate card. Aliases are human-readable names that you can
          #   use in the place of the id of the rate card when provisioning a customer's
          #   contract. By using an alias, you can easily create a contract and provision a
          #   customer by choosing the paygo rate card, without storing the rate card id in
          #   your internal systems. This is helpful when launching a new rate card for
          #   paygo customers, you can update the alias for paygo to be scheduled to be
          #   assigned to the new rate card without updating your code.
          #
          # ### Key response fields:
          #
          # - The ID of the rate card you just created
          #
          # ### Usage guidelines:
          #
          # - After creating a rate card, you can now use the addRate or addRates endpoints
          #   to add products and their prices to it
          # - A rate card alias can only be used by one rate card at a time. If you create a
          #   contract with a rate card alias that is already in use by another rate card,
          #   the original rate card's alias schedule will be updated. The alias will
          #   reference the rate card to which it was most recently assigned.

          # description, and aliases. This endpoint is designed for managing rate card
          # identity and reference aliases rather than modifying pricing rates.
          #
          # Modifies the descriptive properties and alias configuration of a rate card
          # without affecting the underlying pricing rates or schedules. This allows you to
          # update how a rate card is identified and referenced throughout your system.
          #
          # ### Use this endpoint to:
          #
          # - Rate card renaming: Update display names or descriptions for organizational
          #   clarity
          # - Alias management: Add, modify, or schedule alias transitions for seamless rate
          #   card migrations
          # - Documentation updates: Keep rate card descriptions current with business
          #   context
          # - Self-serve provisioning setup: Configure aliases to enable code-free rate card
          #   transitions
          #
          # #### Active contract impact:
          #
          # - Alias changes: Already-created contracts continue using their originally
          #   assigned rate cards.
          # - Other changes made using this endpoint will only impact the Metronome UI.
          #
          # #### Grandfathering existing PLG customer pricing:
          #
          # - Rate card aliases support scheduled transitions, enabling seamless rate card
          #   migrations for new customers, allowing existing customers to be grandfathered
          #   into their existing prices without code. Note that there are multiple
          #   mechanisms to support grandfathering in Metronome.
          #
          # ####How scheduled aliases work for PLG grandfathering: Initial setup:
          #
          # - Add alias to current rate card: Assign a stable alias (e.g.,
          #   "standard-pricing") to your active rate card
          # - Reference alias during contract creation: Configure your self-serve workflow
          #   to create contracts using `rate_card_alias` instead of direct `rate_card_id`
          # - Automatic resolution: New contracts referencing the alias automatically
          #   resolve to the rate card associated with the alias at the point in time of
          #   provisioning
          #
          # ####Grandfathering process:
          #
          # - Create new rate card: Build your new rate card with updated pricing structure
          # - Schedule alias transition: Add the same alias to the new rate card with a
          #   `starting_at` timestamp
          # - Automatic cutover: Starting at the scheduled time, new contracts created in
          #   your PLG workflow using that alias will automatically reference the new rate
          #   card
