        # Creates a new custom field key for a given entity (e.g. billable metric,
        # contract, alert).
        #
        # Custom fields are properties that you can add to Metronome objects to store
        # metadata like foreign keys or other descriptors. This metadata can get
        # transferred to or accessed by other systems to contextualize Metronome data and
        # power business processes. For example, to service workflows like revenue
        # recognition, reconciliation, and invoicing, custom fields help Metronome know
        # the relationship between entities in the platform and third-party systems.
        #
        # ### Use this endpoint to:
        #
        # - Create a new custom field key for Customer objects in Metronome. You can then
        #   use the Set Custom Field Values endpoint to set the value of this key for a
        #   specific customer.
        # - Specify whether the key should enforce uniqueness. If the key is set to
        #   enforce uniqueness and you attempt to set a custom field value for the key
        #   that already exists, it will fail.
        #
        # ### Usage guidelines:
        #
        # - Custom fields set on commits, credits, and contracts can be used to scope
        #   alert evaluation. For example, you can create a spend threshold alert that
        #   only considers spend associated with contracts with custom field key
        #   contract_type and value paygo
        # - Custom fields set on products can be used in the Stripe integration to set
        #   metadata on invoices.
        # - Custom fields for customers, contracts, invoices, products, commits, scheduled
        #   charges, and subscriptions are passed down to the invoice.
